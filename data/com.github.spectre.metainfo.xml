    <p>Reclaim control, delete your passwords</p>
    <p>Goodbye password managers, hello digital independence.</p>
    <p>The Gtk frontend for the Spectre algorthm.</p>
    <p>
      Spectre is a completely novel approach to digital access control.
      Rather than trying to keep countless passwords safe in an app, keychain or browser,
      Spectre holds no passwords at all.
      When it’s time to log in, Spectre calculates your site’s password for you on‑demand,
      storing it nowhere, ensuring it can never be unavailable, lost, or stolen.
      Is that even possible?
      It is now.

        <p>It has almost reached feature parity with the gtk3 branch but is much nicer to look at.
          The password file is in the ~/.spectre.d/name.mpsites (The folder still has to be created manually... pre-release...)
